# Leverage the NEOM digital ecosystem

Whether it is embracing futuristic concepts, pioneering state-of-the-art technologies or creating new lifestyle experiences, redefining global benchmarks is at the core of the NEOM identity. Newer experiences, products and propositions must inherit and leverage existing assets, models and frameworks from existing ecosystems to scale new heights.


## Why/Benefits (to NEOM and Tourists)


1. Create a cohesive and consistent NEOM brand and personality
2. Increase visitor adoption and participation by providing a familiar environment
2. Influence visitors to evolve mental models that are unique to the NEOM eco-system
3. Improved the maturity of the NEOM capabilities by focussing on unaddressed visitor needs
4. Lower development and maintenance costs by promoting reusability of shared capabilities
  

## Key Considerations


1. Does our product reflect NEOM's visual identity?
2. Are we visually consistent with the NEOM personality?
3. Are we focussing on a visitor need that has not been solved within the NEOM ecosystem?

**If a similar capabilities exists...**

4. What were the outcomes and learnings?
5. Is there a possibility that we augment an existing capability, rather than build from scratch?
6. How would be proposed enhancements impact other tenants that are using the existing capability?

**If we are building a unique capability**

7. How can we redefine the global benchmarks?
8. How can we expand the scope to appeal to other tenants?
9. How can features within this capability be configurable?
10. Does to the proposed capability reflect the NEOM visual identity and yet allow for customization?" 

## Practical Actions

1. Discourage a 'build from scratch' approach
2. Encourage tenants to be aware of the assets, models and frameworks existing within the NEOM ecosystem
3. Clearly differentiate between specifications and guidelines to give tenants a clarity on mandates and the flexibility available.
4. Setup repositories (Guardrail documentation and supporting NEOM brand book, design libraries and technical documentation) that can be accessed
5. Incentivise tenants to contribute to and cultive a richer ecosystem
6. Orchestrate and mediate the activities and actions between tenants and maintain strategic touch-points during the product lifecycle.
