# Build for scale

Ensuring the app, its experience and functionality can be scaled/changed/enhanced in the future when new Tenants onboard and the app can handle a significant number of users operating the app simultaneously

{: .highlight } Addresses  increased  usage,  need  to  address  scalability  for  a  feature  perspective


## Why/Benefits (to NEOM and Tourists)

1. Decisions made now do not negatively impact or limit any future decisions or changes in direction
2. Greater number and type of tenants will be efficientely supported
3. Enable multiple tenants enhancing the apps functionality in parallel
4. Fit for purpose governance structure that prevents bottleknecks from forming

## Key Considerations

1. Can the functionality be adapted and resused in the future?
2. Manage large number of transactions, tenants, search across all attractions
3. Can you estimate the number of new users joining the app?
4. Does the new functionality added slow down the app?
5. Is the AR/VR capability, 3D image rendering, high definition embedded video hindering the apps performance & eventually affecting the user experience?
6. Will the app deployment follow a centralized approach (consortium driven ex : Tech & Digital team managed) or follow a decentralized approach (Tenant managed)?
7. What will the CI/CD & Build Train look like for the apps?
8. What will be the navigation architecture be across multiple apps (Super & mini Apps)?
9. What are the external integrations the app may have? Ex: In-App Purchases, Payments integration"
