# Put the visitor at the heart of the experience

Human life is the primary force propelling the vision of NEOM and must be at the centre of all its ecosystems. Maximize impact by distilling a true understanding of the visitors, their context, aspirations and objectives. Donâ€™t just embed visitors in the solutions, but integrate them into the process of crafting these propositions, experiences and products.

## Why/Benefits (to NEOM and Tourists)

1. Makes the visitor's experince better and valued more
2. Empower the user to be self sufficient and independent
3. Increase user satisafaction which improve adoption and participation
4. Improve revenues and profitablity of app
5. Reduces development costs
6. Launch products and feature with a higher confidence 
7. Provide customer experience that is unique to an individual through hyper-personalization 

## Key Considerations

1. Who are the targeted visitor groups?
2. Do we have a clear view of the current context of the targeted user groups?
3. What is the gap that the proposed proposition, experience, or product promise to fill?
4. How are the visitors filling in the existing gap?
5. What benefits does the proposed proposition, experience or product promise the visitor?
6. How do we hyper-personalise the experience for each user by leveraging information from previous site visits/interactions?
7. Did we effectively involve visitors in the research phase?
8. Have we adhered to the user-centred design process?
9. Are there any existing mental models which may be leveraged in the design phase?
10. Have we tested the proposed proposition, experience, or product been tested with real users before the development phase?
11. How did the user feedback impact our thinking and design?
  
## Practical Actions


1. Initiate the project with realistic user metrics.  
2. Engage an experience design team with a proven track record of user centric design.  
3. Create a project plan which includes time for user centric activities like research, validation and iterations.  
4. Involve users early and make them integral to all stages of the product lifecycle.  
5. Ensure the participating visitors are an appropriate representation of the overall visitor base.  
6. Choose an appropriate validation method that aligns with what is being tesed and expected user feedback  
7. Test regularly - As the product is being built, regularly test it with potential users to ensure it meets people's needs.
